# NO MORE JUNK FILES 

Made for those people who are tired of manually cleaning  PS , After effects, Davinci Resolve, Premiere pro ,ANSYS cache/temp files frequently.

Earlier I used to manually go to prefetch file and temp file from "Run dialog box"...select all files and then hit shift delete to delete those files. 
Now I simply click on this exe file and boom all junk at multiple locations (specified by the user) gets deleted within seconds..

## Benefits: 
1) Saves time....Saves Space
2) Smaller than other apps like cc cleaner etc. 
3) Free (genuinely :) and open source
4) Fast and not RAM hungry like google chrome.
5) Will not increase computer boot up time and will not run in background.
6) Lastly ....**Made in India** software.
7) **Customisable** according to your needs

## What it does:
It cleans these locations on windows system in one click :

1)%windir%\temp    
2)%windir%\Prefetch   
3)%windir%\system32\dllcache   
4)%SysteDrive%\Temp    
5)%temp%    
6)%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\History  
7)%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files  
8)%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp 
9)%USERPROFILE%\Recent    
10)%USERPROFILE%\Cookies

11)Any location on the system where temp files get filled repeatedly 
(with a little bit of coding inside the batch file and using that batch file [with .bat extension] or 
converting it into exe with the help of advanced .bat to .exe converter).

### Note : You can schedule it in the task scheduler to perform automatic batch cleaning operation at any time of the day, that too within 3-4 secs.

## NO WORRIES :
Since it is at its early stage and i wanted it to run fast... i haven't made its UI ...so after double clicking the exe ...command prompt will open and close within 3-4 secs displaying some lines of output....some may think that nothing happened and woosh it is gone ....but no!! ...u can check the prefetch folder and all other locations mentioned below ...u will notice that the junk files are  gone...if not then try running the exe as administrator ...since prefetch sometimes blocks users those who aren't admins.
